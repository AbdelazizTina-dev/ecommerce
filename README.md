## Reflection

  - Gomu Shop is the first e-commerce application I've built as a side personal project.
  - The overall design is not my original idea, it's inspired from a learning project on YouTube and I tried to test my limit on how well I can follow a given design mockup and realise it.
  - I've learned a lot of React best practices as I was building this web application and had the chance to integrate both Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation to best suite different use cases and gained experience dealing with the powerful framework that is Next.js.
  - The main obstacle that I faced was making sure the website is fully responsive across multiple devices and screens and I'm proud to say that Gomu Shop is the first project that I was able to realize that goal in.
  - Gomu Shop can still be upgraded with more functionalities such as: Reviews section with the ability to login and post a review, color picker for a product, persisting the cart items...etc.
